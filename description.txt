The app is a digital card game designed to provide both entertainment and competition through single-player and online multiplayer modes.

- Single-Player Mode
Users can play against a DQN-agent opponent.
There are 3 different difficulty levels: 
    - Easy (Random Agent), 
    - Medium (trained on single agent-rule-based)
    - Hard (trained on multi-agent rule-based)
The performance of the neural network can be found in the report inside the brisgo-utilities repository (see below).

- Multiplayer Mode
The app supports real-time online matches between players.
Two types of online matches are available:
    - Public matches, where players are paired automatically using a matchmaking system.
    - Private matches, where players can create a game and invite a specific friend to join.

- Minigames
The app includes 2 additional minigames to enrich gameplay experience
- Hit The Suit
    is a minigame entirely driven by device sensors (ROTATION_VECTOR and GYROSCOPE).
    Players interact with the game by physically rotating and tilting the smartphone to hit the correct card suit.
- Memory card game
    Players must flip cards and remember their positions to find matching pairs.
    This minigame focuses on memory and concentration and follows the traditional rules of the well-known card matching game.

- Face Detection and Emoji Mapping
The app integrates a face detection system that analyzes a photo provided by the user (using MLKit).
Facial expressions are detected from the image.
Each detected expression is mapped to a predefined set of emojis.
During online matches, these emojis can be used to communicate emotions to the opponent.

- User and Game Management
The app includes user authentication and profile management (profile photo, nickname), friendships, player statistics, and ranking system.
Leaderboards are dynamically updated through backend services.

- Backend and Cloud Integration
Cloud-based services are used for data storage, matchmaking, and real-time communication (GCP services and Firebase).
Localization of user position with GPS and reverse geocoding task with Nominatim public API.
